In collaboration with **Newham Council** and **University of East London**, my research focuses on developing a robust framework for **Compound Flood Risk Modelling using AI**, addressing the increasing complexity of flood events driven by climate change. The study integrates diverse datasets, including meteorological, hydrological, and geospatial data, to analyze the interplay between coastal, fluvial, and pluvial flooding. Advanced machine learning and statistical modelling techniques are employed to quantify risk under various scenarios, enabling more accurate predictions of compound flood events. The research leverages Big Data technologies to handle and process large-scale, high-resolution datasets and explores the role of Explainable AI (XAI) in improving transparency and interpretability of flood risk assessments. By providing actionable insights, the thesis aims to inform better decision-making for urban planning, disaster management, and climate resilience strategies.

**Relevant Modules:** Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Cloud Computing, Big Data, IoT.

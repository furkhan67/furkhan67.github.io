Developed an advanced multimodal deep learning model to classify Alzheimer’s disease by integrating handwriting data, MRI scans, and clinical records. The project utilized Big Data frameworks for efficient data preprocessing and management, ensuring scalability for large datasets. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including LIME, were employed to enhance model interpretability and build trust in clinical predictions. Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) were leveraged to generate detailed clinical reports from structured data, streamlining insights for healthcare professionals. By employing innovative feature selection methods and referencing state-of-the-art research, the model achieved significant performance improvements. Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to advance early Alzheimer’s detection and contribute to ongoing academic research.
